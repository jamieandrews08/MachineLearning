SUBDIRECTORY: output 
    Storage location for CSV files generated by analysis.
    Note that this subdirectory is empty.


SUBDIRECTORY: output/images
    Storage location for graphs and plots. created by Q*_plot.py files. 
    Note that this subdirectory is empty;
     all images have been intentionally removed for the purposes of academic honesty.
