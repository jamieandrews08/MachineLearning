The data for these files is contained in the 'data' folder. 

FILENAME : **Q0_parsedata.py**
* ** THIS MUST BE RUN FIRST ** Otherwise, other code will not work.
* Takes data from CSV files and perfoms some inital pre-processing to meet needs of analaysis. Note: the credit data is randomly sampled by this file.
* Output is then saved to in HDF format in the 'data' subdirectory.

FILENAME: **helper.py**
  * Contains class definitions and basic functions used for anlayis by other files in this location. 
  * Functions from this file are imported via python import commands. 
  * Output is routed to the 'output' directory.

FILENAME: **Q1_cluster.py**
  * Performs k means and GMM clustering on the datasets created by Q0_parsedata.py
  * Creates output that is routed to the 'output/benchmark' directory.

FILENAME: **Q1_plot.pynb**
  * Creates plots based omn the output of Q1_cluster.py.
  * Creates output that is routed to the 'output/images/benchmark' directory.
    
FILENAME: **Q2_reduce.py**
  * Applies dimensionality reduction techniques to the data stored in data directory.
  * Output is routed to the following directories:
    - 'output/PCA', 
    - 'output/ICA', 
    - 'output/RP'
    - 'output/RF'
       

FILENAME: **Q2_plot.py**

SUBDIRECTORY: **/output** 
  - Storage location for CSV files generated by the python code performing analysis that are located in this directory. 
  - Note that this subdirectory is empty, all output has been intentionally removed for the purposes of academic honesty.

SUBDIRECTORY: **/output/images**
  - Storage location for graphs and plots created by Q*_plot.py files. 
  - Note that this subdirectory is empty, all images have been intentionally removed for the purposes of academic honesty.
