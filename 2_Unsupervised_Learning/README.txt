(https://github.com/jandrews63/CS7641_Assignment3.git)

The code in this repository was created for CS7641 at Georgia Tech
Unsupervised Learning and Dimensionality Reduction (Assignment 3)

***
Python analysis code was originally obtained from...
Jonathan Tay's GitHub repository 
Location of originals: https://github.com/JonathanTay/CS-7641-assignment-1

Chad Maron's GotHub repository
Location of originals: https://github.com/cmaron/CS-7641-assignments/tree/master/assignment3
and edited to fit the needs of this assignment.

The data for these files is contained in the 'data' folder. The python files in this repository 
process data for each question in Assignment 3 of CS 7641.

FILENAME : Q0_parsedata.py
    ** THIS MUST BE RUN FIRST ** Otherwise, other code will not work.
    Takes data from CSV files and perfoms some inital pre-processing to meet needs of analaysis.
    Note: the credit data is randomly sampled by this file.
    Output is then saved to in HDF format in the 'data' subdirectory.

FILENAME: helper.py
    This file contains class definitions and basic functions used for anlayis by other files in this location. Functions from this file are imported via python import commands. This file creates output that is routed to the 'output' folder.

FILENAME: Q1_cluster.py
    Performs k means and GMM clustering on the datasets created by Q0_parsedata.py
    This file creates output that is routed to the 'output/benchmark' folder.

FILENAME: Q1_plot.pynb
    Creates plots based omn the output of Q1_cluster.py.
    This file creates output that is routed to the 'output/images/benchmark' folder.
    
FILENAME: Q2_reduce.py
    Applies dimensionality reduction techniques to the data stored in data folder.
    This file creates output that is routed to the following locations:
        'output/PCA', 
        'output/ICA', 
        'output/RP'
        'output/RF'
       folder. This file creates output that is routed to the 'output' folder.

FILENAME: Q2_plot.py
    Plots the output of Q2_reduce.py
    This file utilizes the data in the data folder.
    This file creates output that is routed to the following folders:
        'output/images/PCA' 
        'output/images/ICA' 
        'output/images/RP' 
        'output/images/RF' 


FILENAME: Q3_cluster.py
    Performs k means and GMM clustering on the datasets created by Q2_reduce.py
    This file utilizes data in and routes output to the following locations:
        'output/PCA', 
        'output/ICA', 
        'output/RP'
        'output/RF'

FILENAME: Q3_plot.py
    Plots the output of Q3_cluster.py
    This file utilizes data in the following locations:
        'output/PCA', 
        'output/ICA', 
        'output/RP'
        'output/RF'
    This file creates output that is routed to the following folders:
        'output/images/PCA' 
        'output/images/ICA' 
        'output/images/RP' 
        'output/images/RF' 

FILENAME: Q4_ANN.py
    Creates neural network models using reduced data. Performs some exploratory plotting of NN outputs.
    This file utilizes data in the following locations:
        'output/PCA', 
        'output/ICA', 
        'output/RP'
        'output/RF'
    This file creates CSV output that is routed to the following folders:
        'output/PCA' 
        'output/ICA' 
        'output/RP' 
        'output/RF' 
    This file creates images that are routed to the following folders:
        'output/images/PCA' 
        'output/images/ICA' 
        'output/images/RP' 
        'output/images/RF' 

FILENAME: Q5_cluster_ANN.py
    Creates performs clsutering and then creates neural network models using clustered data. 
    Performs some exploratory plotting of NN outputs.

SUBDIRECTORY: output 
    Storage location for CSV files generated by the python code performing analysis that are located in this directory. Note that this subdirectory is empty, all output has been intentionally removed for the purposes of academiv hinesty.

SUBDIRECTORY: output/images
    Storage location for graphs and plots created by Q*_plot.py files. Note that this subdirectory is empty, all images have been intentionally removed for the purposes of academic honesty.
